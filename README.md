# phyllotaxis
This projects aim is to simulate flowers phyllotaxis.

Take a look at the arrangement of this flower's seeds, this project's goal is to find the location of all those seeds and create a 3d representation of the flower using blender. Since it may be a new concept to you, I'll try to explane it a little bit, but for a better understanding of flowers phyllotaxis, read The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants book, Chapter 4. The link to this book is available in the refrences section.

As first step, we find the location of seeds, Two plots below are represent flower with 1000 nodes and 2000 nodes respectively.

The most exsiting thing about flower's seeds arrangement, is that the number of seeds in a spiral is exaxtly integers from the Fibonacci sequence. It is a little hard to trace the spirals by eye, so I reduced to rotation speed, so you can see the spirals.

Now it is easily to trace the spirals and count the seeds in each of them. but the former illustratins is the real flowers phyllotaxis.

As first attempt to generate the 3D model, if we replace the cricles with cubes, this will be the result:

And at last, this is the final result, generated by this package. The blender python api is used to generate 3D model.
